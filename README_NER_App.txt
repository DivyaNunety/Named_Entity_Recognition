1. download NER_app.py file

2.install necessary libraries 

	1) streamlit

	Command: pip install streamlit

	2) Spacy

	Command: pip install spacy

	3) networkx( for knowledge graphs)

	Command: pip install networkx
	
	4) Matplotlib
	
	Command: pip install matplotlib

3. open Cmd prompt in the file location of NER_app.py
   	
	Command: streamlit run NER_app.py
